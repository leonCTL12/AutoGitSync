# CommitPal

## Overview
Have you ever encountered this problem? After a long day of working from home on your personal laptop, you return to the office the next morning and realize… you forgot to commit and push your code. It’s happened to me… a lot.

This tool will periodically commit and push your code to your repository, acting as a backup. It will branch out from the current branch and will not interfere with your working branch.

If there are any bugs, please post an issue.

Disclaimer: This is a personal project, so it may not be very stable. Please use it with caution!
